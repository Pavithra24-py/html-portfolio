<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a wealth of knowledge and experience that spans process and design engineering, research and data analysis, content strategy, content writing, editing, proofreading, and PR. 
  Working in B2C and B2B environments has allowed me to enhance my designing, researching, and written skills and understanding of brand identity and tone of voice.</p>


<p>I think out of the box and break new ground if required. Sharing and communicating will be the heart and brain of the brand through my content. 
  I adore researching, learning, and writing and am obsessed with getting outstanding results.</p>
